# Megaline-mobile-customers
About the project: Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra.
You have access to behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the new plans (from the project for the Statistical Data Analysis course). For this classification task, you need to develop a model that will pick the right plan. Since youâ€™ve already performed the data preprocessing step, you can move straight to creating the model.
Develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. In this project, the threshold for accuracy is 0.75. Check the accuracy using the test dataset.

Summary results: After the data exploration, 
* We splited the data into test, train and validation set.
* Investigate the quality of different models by changing hyperparameters.
* Checked the quality of the model using the test set.
* Performed sanity checks on models used.

Got an accuracy score of 80.5% which was above the desired accuracy level.
